The algorithm efficiently trains a global model that is capable of using its recent experiences to quickly adapt, achieving fast online adaptation in dynamic environments.
They evaluate 2 version of approaches on stochastic continuous control tasks:
(1) Recurrence-Based Adaptive Learner (ReBAL)
(2) Gradient-Based Adaptive Learner (GrBAL)
Objective Setting-Up To adapt the dynamic environment, we require a learned model $p_{\theta}^*$ to adapt, using an update rule $u_{\psi}^*$ after seeing M data points from some new &amp;ldquo;task&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Part III - From AlphaGo to MuZero</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_iii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 17:02:31 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_iii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</guid><description>Mastering Atari, Go, Chess and Shogi by Planning with a Learned Model It is just the paper proposing MuZero. MuZero is quite famous when I write this note(Jan 2021). Lots of people tried to reproduce the incredible performance of the paper. Some of well-known implementations like muzero-general give a clear and modular implementation of MuZero. If you are interested in MuZero, you can play with it. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s diving into the paper.</description></item><item><title>Part II - From AlphaGo to MuZero</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_ii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 16:54:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_ii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</guid><description>Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge The paper propose AlphaGo Zero which is known as self-playing without human knowledge.

It defines the contraint like
$$\frac{\partial Q_{tot}}{\partial Q_{a}} \geq 0, \forall a$$
where $Q_{tot}$ is the joint value function and $Q_{a}$ is the value function for each agent.
An intuitive eplaination is that we want the weights of any individual value function $Q_{a}$ are positive. If the weights of individual value function $Q_{a}$ are negative, it will discourage the agent to cooperate, since the higher $Q_{a}$, the lower joint value $Q_{tot}$.</description></item><item><title>Part I - From AlphaGo to MuZero</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_i-from_alphago_to_muzero/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 01:14:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_i-from_alphago_to_muzero/</guid><description>AlphaGo is quite famous when I was a freshman of college. It somehow is the reason that I was addicted to Reinforcement Learning. Thus Our journey of model-based RL will start here. Although it is not the first one that propose model-based RL, I still believe it will give a big picture of model-based RL.
Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search Introduction AlphaGo combines 2 kinds of model, including policy network and value network.</description></item><item><title>An Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandit Problem</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/bandit/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:11:41 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/bandit/</guid><description>Multi-Armed Bandit Problem Imagine you are in a casionoand face multiple slot machines. Each machine is configured with an unknown probability of how likely you would get a reward at one play. The question is What&amp;rsquo;s the strategy to get the highest long-term reward?
