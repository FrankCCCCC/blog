The main different between 3 kinds of estimation is **What do we assume for the prior?** The **Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE) doesn't use any prior but only maiximize the probability according to the samples**. On the other hand, MAP and Bayesian both use priors to estimate the probability. **The Maximum A Posteriori(MAP) only use the probability of single event** while **Bayesian Estimation see a distribution as the prior**.
