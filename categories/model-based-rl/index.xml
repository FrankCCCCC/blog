MuZero is quite famous when I write this note(Jan 2021). Lots of people tried to reproduce the incredible performance of the paper. Some of well-known implementations like muzero-general give a clear and modular implementation of MuZero. If you are interested in MuZero, you can play with it. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s diving into the paper.</description></item><item><title>Part II - From AlphaGo to MuZero</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_ii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Mar 2021 16:54:39 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_ii-from_alphago_to_muzero/</guid><description>Mastering the game of Go without human knowledge The paper propose AlphaGo Zero which is known as self-playing without human knowledge.
Reinforcement learning in AlphaGo Zero $$ (p, v) = f_{\theta} $$
$$ l = (z - v)^2 - \pi^T log(p) + c||\theta||^2 $$
Mastering Chess and Shogi by Self-Play with a General Reinforcement Learning Algorithm The paper propose AlphaZero which is known as self-playing to compete any kinds of board game.</description></item><item><title>Part I - From AlphaGo to MuZero</title><link>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_i-from_alphago_to_muzero/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Feb 2021 01:14:40 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://frankccccc.github.io/blog/posts/part_i-from_alphago_to_muzero/</guid><description>AlphaGo is quite famous when I was a freshman of college. It somehow is the reason that I was addicted to Reinforcement Learning. Thus Our journey of model-based RL will start here. Although it is not the first one that propose model-based RL, I still believe it will give a big picture of model-based RL.
Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search Introduction AlphaGo combines 2 kinds of model, including policy network and value network.</description></item></channel></rss>
